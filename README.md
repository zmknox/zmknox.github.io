Website for zmknox

This repo contains an Eleventy site with information about me and my projects, plus any blog posts I may write. It used to have a Jekyll site that I hosted on GitHub Pages, hence the repository name, but these days I host it on Cloudflare Pages.

Theme used is (very heavily) customized from [DevJournal](https://github.com/hemangsk/DevJournal) by Hermang Kumar
