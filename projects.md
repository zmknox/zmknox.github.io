#### This is a list of my projects past and present. I have also contributed to some [SRCT](http://srct.gmu.edu/) projects that may not be listed, which you can find here: [<i class="fa fa-github"></i> SRCT](https://github.com/SRCT)




Current Projects
================

### Bingo Card Generator
A simple Node.js/Express app to generate 'bingo' cards for major events (like Apple keynotes)
filled with predictions using a JSON file.

### SRCT Weather
Weather apps all provide similar information, so it's a nice playground to try new things. SRCT is building
a mobile-responsive website to show the weather for all of the Mason campuses, in a beautiful.

### What's Open for iOS
SRCT provides an API for determining which resturants (and other locations) around the Mason campus are open.
The goal of this project is to use that API in a native app using native Swift and UIKit.

Past Projects
=============

### Breakout
This was a project made for my introductory computer science class's year end
project. It has a couple bugs but it fully playable. I hope you enjoy it.

_Future Projects?_ I've got an idea in mind for a surprising productivity app for iOS. Hopefully I'll be able to work on that more soon...
