# Hi there. I'm Zach.

I'm a software developer. On this website you'll find information about me,
my projects, and any blog posts I may write (mostly about my projects or experiences).
All content on this site is mine unless otherwise specified, and my opinions do not reflect
or represent the views of my exployer or school.

**Programming Experience:** I have the most experience with Swift (for iOS development), JavaScript
(developing APIs and backend tools), Java (used a lot in school), and Python (3, please).  I'm also familliar with C, Kotlin, and probably some things I've forgotten about. I can also build a website (like this one) with HTML/CSS, but I wouldn't really classify that as programming.

**Framework Experience:** UIKit (Swift, iOS Development), Node.js (backends and APIs), ExpressJS, React (JS), Flask (Python), Android (Kotlin/Java), Django (Python), Bootstrap (HTML/CSS/JS), Meteor (JS), Material Design Lite (HTML/CSS)

**System Experience:** macOS (OS X), Linux/UNIX (preferring a Debian/Ubuntu base), Windows (including some Windows Server knowledge), Cisco IOS

**Tools Experience:** git (version control), Visual Studio Code, vim, Xcode, Slack, various office suites

My preferred text editor is Visual Studio Code. Xcode is pretty good too. IntelliJ's debugger is fantastic. vim is fine in a pinch.

I also have experience with video editing. Most of my experience is with Apple's Final Cut Pro X.
I feel fairly competent at being able to produce decent quality video content with it.

**Accomplishments**:
-   Apple WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) 2019 Scholarship Winner
-   Apple WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) 2018 Scholarship Winner
-   Eagle Scout (as of December 2014)
-   Cisco Certified ENT (ICND1) (as of June 2015)
