# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. I'm {{ site.firstName }}.

<h4 class="about-pronouns"><em>({{ site.pronouns }})</em></h4>

I'm a software developer. I build backend tools in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for work, and iOS apps in [Swift](https://swift.org/) for me. I also write a web app or two here and there using various tools (this site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), for example). I like to try new frameworks and tools, so I'd like to think that I know at least a little bit about a lot of things. Check out my [Projects page]({{ "/projects" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to see everything I (publicly) work on.

_Here are some interesting things about me:_

I [went to school](https://gmu.edu/) for Computer Science. I took all the usual suspects of courses: Algorithms, Data Structures, Architectures; but I also learned a lot (both about writing code and working with others) while building projects with [Mason SRCT](https://srct.gmu.edu) outside of class.

In both [2018]({{ "/2018/04/02/WWDC-scholarship-application.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and [2019]({{ "/2019/03/24/WWDC19-scholarship-application.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), I won scholarships to attend Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It was an incredible experience, and [I wrote about my 2018 trip on this site]({{ "/wwdc/2018/08/03/thoughts-on-wwdc18.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

Myke Hurley once called me ["important in Upgrade lore"](https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-R0sbo/54:08). I've made a [couple](https://upgrade.cards/) of cool [projects](https://upgradies.com/) related to Upgrade to warrant this.

In 2015, I learned a lot about routers and switches and passed the Cisco ICND1 exam, becoming a Cisco Certified Enter Network Technician. I think that certification has expired by now, but the knowledge and experience of that was valuable.

My preferred text editor is currently [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Xcode is pretty good too. [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)'s debugger is fantastic. vim is fine in a pinch. I used to list out a whole bunch of programming languages I've been exposed to here, but I don't think that's super useful. I can get going in most programming languages pretty quickly, and learn the quirks as I go. I'm certainly most proficient with JavaScript (with Node.js) and Swift (for iOS), though.

From doing various personal projects, I have some experience with video and audio editing, mostly with [Final Cut Pro](https:/www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) and [Logic](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/). You can see some of them [on YouTube](http://youtube.com/c/ZachKnoxM/).

I like to [write little reviews on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/zmknox/) after I watch movies. It helps me think more about what I'm watching.

Finally, I am an Eagle Scout.
