# Hi there. I'm Zach.

I'm a software developer. On this website you'll find information about me,
my projects, and any blog posts I may write (mostly about my projects or experiences).
All content on this site is mine unless otherwise specified, and my opinions do not reflect
or represent the views of my exployer or school.

**Programming Experience:** I have the most experience with Swift (for iOS development),
Java (used a lot in school), Node JS, and Python (3, please).  I have familliarity with C,
but I've also only ever written school assignments with it. I can also build a website (like
this one) with HTML/CSS, but I wouldn't really classify that as programming.

**Framework Experience:** UIKit, Node JS/NPM, ExpressJS, Meteor, Flask, Android, Django, Bootstrap, Material Design Lite

**System Experience:** macOS (OS X), Linux/UNIX, Windows (including some Windows Server knowledge), Cisco IOS

**Tools Experience:** git (version control), Visual Studio Code, vim, Xcode, Slack, various office suites

My favorite text editor is Visual Studio Code. Xcode is pretty good too. IntelliJ's debugger is fantastic.

I also have experience with video editing. Most of my experience is with Apple's Final Cut Pro X.
I feel fairly competent at being able to produce decent quality video content with it.

**Accomplishments**:
-   Apple WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) 2019 Scholarship Winner
-   Apple WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) 2018 Scholarship Winner
-   Eagle Scout (as of December 2014)
-   Cisco Certified ENT (ICND1) (as of June 2015)
