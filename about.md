# üëã Hi there, I'm {{ site.firstName }}!

<div class="about-pronouns">
<h4>({{ site.pronouns }})</h4>
</div>

I'm a software developer. I build (mostly backend, serverless, automation + test focused) tools with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for work, and iOS apps with [Swift](https://swift.org/) for me. I also write a web app or two here and there using various tools (this site uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), for example). I like to try new frameworks and tools, so I'd like to think that I know at least a little bit about a lot of things. Check out my [Projects page]({{ "/projects" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to see everything I (publicly) work on.

#### _**Here are some interesting things about me:**_

I went to school for Computer Science. I took all the usual suspects of courses: Algorithms, Data Structures, Architectures; but I also learned a lot (both about writing code and working with others) while building projects with [Mason SRCT](https://github.com/srct) outside of class.

In both [2018]({{ "/2018/04/wwdc-scholarship-application" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and [2019]({{ "/2019/03/wwdc19-scholarship-application" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), I won scholarships to attend Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It was an incredible experience, and [I wrote about my 2018 trip on this site]({{ "/wwdc/2018/08/thoughts-on-wwdc18" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

Myke Hurley once called me ["important in Upgrade lore"](https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-R0sbo/54:08). I've made a [couple](https://upgrade.cards/) of cool [projects](https://upgradies.com/) related to Upgrade to warrant this.

In 2015, I learned a lot about routers and switches and passed the Cisco ICND1 exam, becoming a Cisco Certified Enter Network Technician. I think that certification has expired by now, but the knowledge and experience of that was valuable.

From doing various personal projects, I have some experience with video and audio editing, mostly with [Final Cut Pro](https:/www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) and [Logic](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/). You can see some of them [on YouTube](http://youtube.com/@zmknox/).

I like to [write little reviews on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/zmknox/) after I watch movies. It helps me think more about what I'm watching.

Also: [I'm trans]({{ "/2025/03/i-am-visible" | prepend: site.baseurl }})! That isn't particularly important to what I do with computers, but it is an important part of me. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
