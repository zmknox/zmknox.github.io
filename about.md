# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. I'm Zach.

I'm a software developer. I build backend tools in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for work, and iOS apps in [Swift](https://swift.org/) for me. I also write a web app or two here and there using various tools (this site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), for example). I like to try new frameworks and tools, so I'd like to think that I know at least a little bit about a lot of things. Check out my [Projects page](https://zachknox.com/projects) to see everything I (publicly) work on.

In both [2018](https://zachknox.com/2018/04/02/WWDC-scholarship-application.html) and [2019](https://zachknox.com/2019/03/25/WWDC19-scholarship-application.html), I won scholarships to attend Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It was an incredible experience, and [I wrote about my 2018 trip on this site](https://zachknox.com/wwdc/2018/08/03/thoughts-on-wwdc18.html).

I [went to school](https://gmu.edu/) for Computer Science, if that's important to you.

Myke Hurley once called me ["important in Upgrade lore"](https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-R0sbo/54:08).

My preferred text editor is currently [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Xcode is pretty good too. [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)'s debugger is fantastic. vim is fine in a pinch.

In 2015, I learned a lot about routers and switches and passed the Cisco ICND1 exam, becoming a Cisco Certified Enter Network Technician. I think that certification has expired by now, but the knowledge and experience of that was valuable.

From doing various personal projects, I have some experience with video and audio editing, mostly with [Final Cut Pro X](https:/www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) and [Logic](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/). You can see some of them [on YouTube](http://youtube.com/c/ZachKnoxM/).

Whenever I watch a movie, I like to [write a little review on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/zmknox/). It helps me think more about what I'm watching.

Finally, I am also an Eagle Scout.
