# Hi there. I'm Zach.

I'm currently a full time Computer Science student at George Mason University. Here you can find
a lot of different information about me and my projects, as well as any blog posts I may write. This website is a personal site, and therefore all opinions here are my own and not that of any person or group I may be affiliated with (unless otherwise specified).

If you want to verify who I really am, I'm on [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) @zmknox.

You can find me on Github too (that's actually where this site is hosted)!
