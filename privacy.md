I will always try and keep your privacy in mind in everything I build. Here is some information
on what data, if any, my projects collect.

---------------------------

## Specifics per app/site:



#### zachknox.com

avaScript libraries (Bootstrap, FontAwesome, jQuery) in order to improve the site’s appearance and
functionality. The only information collected about you is that a web request was received by your
IP address to this website, which is logged by CloudFlare in order to aggregate traffic
statistics. [You can find CloudFlare’s privacy policy here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).
