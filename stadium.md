# Stadium Browser

Stadium is a full screen web browser with custom user agent support!

Features:
- Full screen view! Only one menu button displayed on screen
- User agent support. Change your user agent if a website requires it
- Authentication support. Go to a webpage without your preset user agent if needed
- ~~Game Controller support. Use a paired Bluetooth game controller on any supported webpage~~

Stadium is created by me, [{{ site.name }}](https://twitter.com/zmknox). I hope you enjoy it.
