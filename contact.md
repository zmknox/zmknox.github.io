## Need to get in touch? Here's how
##### There are many ways you can get in touch with me if needed. Here are a few I'd recommend

-----------------

### Secure IM
You can send me a secure message on [<i class="fa fa-key"></i> Keybase](https://keybase.io/zmknox).
Unfortunately I cannot share information for you to contact me via iMessage or Signal, as much as I'd
like to. Both of those services require a phone number (or in the case of iMessage, an email address)
to communicate, and don't allow using simply a username.

### Email

You can send me an email using this form below. (I realize web forms for email are weird,
but I also don't want to just publicly post an email address either).

<form action="https://formspree.io/form@zachknox.com" method="POST">
    <p>Your Name: <br /><input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Toucan Sam"></p><br />
    <p>Your Email address: <br /><input type="email" name="_replyto" placeholder="sam@frootloops.yum"></p><br />
    <p>Message subject: <br /><input type="text" name="_subject" placeholder="Need more Froot Loops"></p><br />
    <p>Your message:<br /><textarea name="contents" placeholder="Message" cols="40" rows="6"></textarea></p><br />
    <p><input name="submit" type="submit" value="Submit" /></p>
</form>


If you would like to contact me securely, you can find my PGP key <a href="/pgp.html">here</a>.
