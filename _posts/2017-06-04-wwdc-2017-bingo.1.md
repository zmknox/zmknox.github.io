WWDC begins tomorrow! I won't be there in person, but I'll certainly be watching from afar.
To celebrate, I created a little keynote bingo site for you to generate your bingo card from.
There are lots of different items (certainly more than 25), so feel free to click generate a
few times before sticking with a card.

This bingo site, which itself is hosted with Github pages on the same site as this, is based on my
bingo-card-generator project which I started last winter. That project runs the server using NodeJS and
Express, but the app itself is all client side.

You can find that project here:

Also thanks to [Myke and Jason on Upgrade](https://relay.fm/upgrade/143) and
[Marco, John, & Casey on ATP](http://atp.fm/episodes/224) for giving me more
ideas of what items to put onto the bingo card.
