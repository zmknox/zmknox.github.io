It's WWDC season again! This year, I decided to submit a scholarship application to hopefully be awarded a ticket.

I've released my code, essays, and a video demo if you want to see what I did, or get inspiration for next year!

#### Update [April 20]: See You in San Jose!

I still can't believe it but I won a WWDC18 scholarship! I'll be sure to post here about my experiences!
