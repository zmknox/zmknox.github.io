It's that time again! Another Apple keynote is coming (and I'll be there in person this time!), and
with every Apple Keynote I always have to make an interactive bingo card! And so I did! Check it out
and play along while you watch the keynote.

But wait, there's more!

Earlier this week, Myke and Jason of [Upgrade](https://relay.fm/upgrade) did their WWDC18 keynote draft,
and I decided to make an interactive scorecard for it also (you may have seen a link to it in their show
notes...). Be sure to [Check that out as well](/bingo/wwdc2018/draft.html)

_Note from the future: the bingo site this post refers to is no longer online. But you can still find my code for the generator on GitHub! The draft scorecard now lives on [upgrade.cards](https://upgrade.cards/)_
