title: My App Defaults for 2024
date: 2023-12-30T12:00:00-05:00
---

It’s time for a new year and so, inspired by an [initiative spawned by the Hemipsheric Views podcast and further expanded by Robb Knight](https://defaults.rknight.me) for folks to share their default apps, I thought I’d share a default app list of my own! This is primarily focused on stuff I use outside of my actual job, which also means my list is extremely iPhone and iPad focused. I have a personal Mac, but I use it shockingly little as of late. 

<!-- excerpt --><!-- more -->

📨 Mail Client
- [Gmail](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) and [Fastmail](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fastmail-email-calendar/id931370077?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) for iOS. I don’t particularly love them, but they do the job.
- RIP [Mailbox](https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9873268/why-dropbox-mailbox-shutdown), the only good mobile email app
 
📮 Mail Server
- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) for personal. Because of course it is. I certainly don’t use Yahoo! mail.
- [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com) for domain mail. Particularly good is you have a bunch of domains you want to manage on one account.
 
📝 Notes
- [Apple Notes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). I find the system app to be sufficient for the vast majority of my quick note-taking needs.
- [Day One](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal-private-diary/id1044867788?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) for journaling. I highly recommend everyone try journaling, at least for a bit. It may not be for you, but I find that getting whatever thoughts I have out of my head to be immensely valuable.
 
✅ To-Do
- [Reminders](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reminders/id1108187841?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). I have no formal task management system. It mostly boils down to “_Siri, remind me to do laundry tomorrow at 11 AM_”
  
📷 iPhone Photo Shooting
- [Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/camera/id1584216193?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). I’ve tried third party camera apps and, while they’re great, they never end up sticking for me.
 
🟦 Photo Management
- [iCloud Photos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photos/id1584215428?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). I live in the ecosystem, and so iCloud is all I really need for photo management.
 
🎞️ Image and Vector Editors
- [Pixelmator Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator-pro/id1289583905?mt=12&itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). Truly one of my favorite apps and developers of all time. They make a stellar image editor and have been continually improving it for over a decade.
- [Pixelmator for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). You’d think it would be hard to do complex image edits on a phone, but I’ve done this time and time again. If I have an idea for some silly meme, I can make it on my phone right then and there.
- [Affinity Designer 2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/affinity-designer-2/id1616831348?mt=12&itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). I’m not great at making vector graphics, but the Affinity suite is still a really great tool whenever I need to make some.
 
🎬 Video Editor
- [Final Cut Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12&itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) for Mac. I’m far from a professional, but I always find a great deal of joy whenever I open Final Cut. It makes editing fun for me.
- [LumaFusion](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) for iPad and iPhone. This serves a similar purpose to Pixelmator for iOS. Good for making quick meme videos. I’m not at all competent at using it well, but it’s a good tool to have if I need it.
 
🎧 Audio Editor
- [Logic Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logic-pro/id634148309?mt=12&itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) for Mac. Logic is super powerful, and I barely know how to use it. But it’s got everything I need if I want to play around with music, edit podcast-style stuff, or just clip something out. Not as fun as Final Cut though.
- [Ferrite](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) for iPad. It’s incredible what you can do with this app. It makes it easy to work on podcast-style audio with the same speed I might in Logic, but on a much more comfortable device.
 
📆 Calendar
- [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) via [Apple Calendar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calendar/id1108185179?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) app. Nothing special.
 
📁 Cloud File Storage
- [iCloud Drive](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive). I don’t rely that much on cloud storage beyond basic documents, where iCloud Drive is sufficient
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) for sharing files, because iCloud is still not quite sufficient in that area..
 
📖 RSS
- Not a frequent user, but [NetNewsWire](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) when doing so.
 
🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts
- [iCloud Contacts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/contacts/id1069512615?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). Why are these in iCloud but my calendar is in Google? I don’t really know.

🌐 Browser
- [Arc](https://arc.net) on Mac. I love love love some of its UI innovations. The sidebar and Mini Arc are truly great features. 
- [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/safari/id1146562112?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) on iPhone and iPad. Safari is the only browser on iOS that supports extensions, so I wouldn’t even consider switching.
 
💬 Chat

I will basically use whatever app I need to to reach folks
- [iMessage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/messages/id1146560473?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200)
- [Discord](https://discord.com)
- [Slack](https://slack.com)
- [Signal](https://www.signal.org)
- [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com)
- I have others but don’t really use them…
 
🗣️ Social apps
- [Ivory](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) for Mastodon, connecting to the very nice [snailedit.social](https://snailedit.social/about)
- [Threads](https://www.threads.net), for the people who aren’t on Mastodon
 
🔖 Bookmarks
- [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/safari/id1146562112?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). But tbh I basically never make bookmarks.
 
📑 Read It Later
- [GoodLinks](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodlinks/id1474335294?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). A really nice app with a really easy to use extension that I don’t use nearly enough. I add a bunch of stuff there, sure. But I don’t often go to actually read it.
 
📜 Word Processing

Equal opportunity word processing!
- [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) for collaboration
- [Pages](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) for personal things
- [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word) for more formal things
 
📈 Spreadsheets
- [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/). Numbers confuses me and Excel sheets are harder to live collaborate on, so Google Sheets it is.
 
📊 Presentations
- [Keynote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id409183694?mt=12&itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). There really is no comparison here. Keynote is ahead of the other presentation apps by a mile. It’s another one of those apps that feels fun to use.

🎵 Music
- [Apple Music](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). I like the library-focused approach Apple takes, as I’d built up my iTunes library for years before Apple Music launched, and still add in a bunch of stuff that isn’t on Apple Music to my library regularly. I also find their playlists and some of their radio shows to be quite good.
- [Sonos Radio](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/sonos-radio). It may have ads, but I find their mixes to be quite solid, and wish they offered more than radio.
- Rarely [YouTube Music](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-music/id1017492454?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) if I’m looking for something not on Apple Music

🎤 Podcasts
- [Overcast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). Which gets _a lot_ of use.
 
🔐 Password Management
- [1Password](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id1511601750?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200). I don’t despise 1Password 8 like many do, but it can be frustrating at times. In general, though, I still find it to be the tool that fits my needs the best. Except…
- [iCloud Keychain](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/passkeys-passwords-devices-iph82d6721b2/ios) for Passkeys. I find the system integration for passkeys to be smoother, at least for now. Maybe this will change in the future, but I’m split at present.
 
📋 Clipboard Manager
- [Pastebot](https://tapbots.com/pastebot/). Everybody should use a clipboard manager. They;re truly invaluable tools that can change how you work, I find that Pastebot’s simple overlay and features like sequential paste work well for me.
 
🧑‍💻 Code Editor
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). I’ve tried everything, but always keep coming back to VS Code. Yes, it’s Electron. But it has every feature I need, extensions for any language I will ever use, and works everywhere. As someone who primarily works with JavaScript, it works great for me.
 
⌨️ Terminal
- [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com). The built-in macOS terminal is fine, but I appreciate the extra customization options that iTerm provides.

And that’s my list! I hope you found something interesting in the list. And be sure to check out [Robb’s web page](https://defaults.rknight.me) which links to everyone else’s app defaults.
