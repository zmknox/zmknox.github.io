You may remember my [interactive draft scorecards](/bingo/drafts) for the [Upgrade podcast](https://relay.fm/upgrade). I'm back at making podcast-based web apps again, this time in a more official capacity.

I've worked with [Myke Hurley](https://twitter.com/imyke) to build a site holding a hall of fame of Upgradies, their annual awards show, winners and runners up: [Upgradies.com](https://upgradies.com/)! I had a good time making it, and hope you all enjoy it!

Some interesting bits about the site:
- I created the site using React. I find React pretty easy to work with, and I found the components nature to work well for a site like this with repeated content like Award entries.
- The [iTunes Store API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/) is really useful. I used it to grab image links to use for various apps, movies, or podcasts.
- For the 2014 awards, I needed to find an image for Mailbox for Mac—an app that no longer exists :(—and wasn't sure what to do. I then realized that I still had my copy of the Mailbox beta on my machine, so I could grab it from there!
- Check out the [2018 Game of the Year award](https://upgradies.com/year/2018#game-of-the-year). I added a random selection for the displayed image because I couldn't decide which box art to use.
