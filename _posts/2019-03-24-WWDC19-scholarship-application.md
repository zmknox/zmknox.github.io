WWDC is coming soon, and that means I've built a schoarship application Playground again! It's my second year applying, and the last year I'll be elligable. This year I built camera filters that show the symptoms of various eye diseases. For example: I've got a near-sighted filter, a colorblind filter, and a light sensitive filter. I hope you give it a shot, because I feel like it's a lot cooler in person than simply watching a video.

As last year, I've released my code, essays, and created a video demo if you want to see what I did, or get inspiration for next year!
