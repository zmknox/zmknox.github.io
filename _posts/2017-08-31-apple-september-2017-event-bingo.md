Another September, another Apple event! I have once again and created a bingo card generator for this one.
I tried to put most things I thought were plausible at least (well maybe not the Mac Pro) on there, but
will probably be updating it as we get closer to the September 12th event.

### Update [September 10]:

I've updated the bingo card generator for this event to include more items (some based on the [Upgrade Keynote Draft](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/157)) and add the ability to color each cell of the card as blue (to mark a correct item)
or red (to mark an incorrect item) to make it easier to play along while you watch the keynote.

I also realize that many of these items are somewhat moot by the leaks from this weekend, but it's all for fun!
