Today, I launched a new web browser app for iOS. It displays webpages in full screen, allows you to change your user agent, has a way to authenticate without the user agent, and has game controller support. How strange!

Stadium is specialized, but it happens to be great for using game streaming services! I posted a guide on how to use it with Google Stadia [on the /r/Stadia subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/j1ar15/use_stadia_on_ios_with_controller_support_easily/).

Stadium is free, so I encourage you to try it out with your favorite webpages! (or just want a browser that opens to [zombo.com](https://html5zombo.com/) every time).
